As part of Parallel Comuting course at Afeka TLV ,I was asked to parallelize 
a sequential program using MPI.

We created a static and dynamic options for given program that performs
heavy computations hence it's name heavy(int x,int y).

we collected the difference in result execution time and made a comparison 

created by Omer Nachshon and Chen Shelly.
